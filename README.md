## Directories

`/data`: the process to build implied volatility using raw data from OneTick.

`/functions`: shared functions that are imported in various files to process
data, generate implied volatility, and construct vol skew models.

`/literature`: research papers relevant to the modelling of implied volatility
using different 

`/meeting_notes`: our meeting discussions and next steps.

`/modeling`: models for the implied volatility curve using hyperbolic regression
for Log Moneyness and sigmoid inverse regression for Delta.

`/prediction`: framework for validating model performance and predicting parameters.
